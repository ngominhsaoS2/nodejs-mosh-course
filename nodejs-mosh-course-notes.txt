11. Global Object
console is one of the global objects in JavaScript. NodeJs also has other global objects.
setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), setInterval(), clearInterval()...

On NodeJS, we dont have "window" global object, instead we have "global" as global object.
console.log(global.message) will return undefined.
