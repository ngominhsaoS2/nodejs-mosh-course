11. Global Object
console is one of the global objects in JavaScript. NodeJs also has other global objects.
setTimeout(), clearTimeout(), setInterval(), clearInterval()...

On NodeJS, we dont have "window" global object, instead we have "global" as global object.
console.log(global.message) will return undefined.



12. Modules
console.log(module);
In NodeJs, every file can be considered as a module.



13. Creating a Module



14. Loading a Module
Use const logger = require('./logger'); instead of using var.
Because we dont want to accidentally change the logger variable.



15. Module Wrapper Function
In logger.js file, Node actually does not execute the code. Instead, Node wraps
everything in side the file into a function like below:

(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // code inside js file go here
    ...
})

This function is called "Module Wrapper Function"



16. Path Module



17. OS Module



18. File System Module



19. Events Module
Event is a signal that something has happened.

const EventEmitter = require('events'); :EventEmitter uppcase like this means this EventEmitter is a Class.
It's not a function, not a simple value, it's a class. Class contains properties, methods.
We have to create an instance of that class.



20. Event Arguments
We can pass data when emit even.



21. Extending Event Emitter
When a function is inside a class, it is called method.



22. HTTP Module
const server = http.createServer(); :server is exact EventEmitter.



25. Package.json
npm init :to create a package.json, then follow the instruction.
This step must be done before creating any package on Node.

npm init --yes :to setup default values for your answers.



26. Installing a Node Package
npm i underscore 



27. Using a Package
Priorities to load a module:
    - core modules
    - file or folder
    - node_modules



28. Package Dependencies



29. NPM Packages and Source Control
Add .gitignore file.



30. Semantic Versioning
major.minor.patch is called Semantic Version

^5.13.2 equals to 5.x.y
~5.13.2 equals to 5.13.x



31. Listing the Installed Packages
npm list :to list out exact version of installed packages.
npm list --depth=0 :just list out version of your app dependencies.



32. Viewing Registry Info for a Package
npm view <packagename> :to view some info of the package.
npm view <packagename> dependencies :to view the package's dependencies.
npm view <packagename> versions :to view the package's release notes.
